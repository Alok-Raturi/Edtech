# Edtech
This is a edtech android app made by me with the help of firebase and react native.
I have used react native for its frontend and firebase for backend.
I learned about
* React native
* React native navigation
* React native splash Screen
* rn-fetch-blob
* React native firebase
* Google Sign in via firebase and react native
* react native feathers for logos
* Different hooks used in react native(like useLayoutEffect, useState, useEffect etc.)
* Context API for state management
and many more is yet to learn.
